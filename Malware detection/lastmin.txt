raw_data.columns: This code lists all the column names present in our dataset.

raw_data.describe(include="all"): It shows some basic statistics about the dataset, like the count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values for each column. The "include='all'" part means it will show statistics for both numerical and categorical columns.

raw_data.info(): This command gives us information about the dataset, like the number of rows and columns, and also tells us the data type of each column (e.g., numbers, text, etc.).

data = raw_data: Here, we're making a copy of the original dataset and storing it in a new variable called "data." This will help us work with the data while keeping the original intact.

data["classification"].value_counts(): This line counts how many times each value appears in the "classification" column. It tells us how many "benign" and how many "malware" samples we have.

data['classification'] = data.classification.map({'benign':0, 'malware':1}): This code converts the text labels "benign" and "malware" in the "classification" column to numerical values. We'll use 0 for "benign" and 1 for "malware" to help the computer understand the data better.

data.head(): This command shows us the first few rows of the modified "data" dataset, so we can see how it looks after the changes.

data = data.sample(frac=1).reset_index(drop=True): We're shuffling the rows of the "data" dataset randomly. Imagine we have cards, and we're mixing them up so that the order is not the same as before.
Import necessary libraries:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt: Importing the matplotlib.pyplot module to create visualizations.
import seaborn as sns: Importing the seaborn library, which provides high-level interface for informative statistical graphics.
Count the occurrences of each classification value in the "classification" column:

data['classification'].value_counts(): Counting the occurrences of each unique value in the "classification" column (i.e., the target variable).
Visualize the class distribution using a count plot:

sns.countplot(x='classification', data=data): Creating a count plot to visualize the distribution of classes (benign and malware) in the target variable.
Calculate the correlation matrix for the dataset:

corrMatrix = data.corr(): Calculating the correlation matrix for all the numeric columns in the dataset. This shows the relationships between different features.
Create a heatmap to visualize the correlation matrix:

sns.heatmap(corrMatrix, annot=True): Displaying a heatmap using Seaborn to visualize the correlation matrix with annotations.
Data preparation:

X = data.drop([...], axis=1): Creating a new DataFrame "X" by dropping specific columns from the original "data" DataFrame, including features like "hash" and some irrelevant columns.
Y = data["classification"]: Creating a target variable "Y" by extracting the "classification" column from the original "data" DataFrame.
Split the dataset into training and test sets:

x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.2, random_state=1): Splitting the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split from scikit-learn.
Data normalization using StandardScaler:

scaler = StandardScaler(): Creating an instance of StandardScaler to normalize the data.
x_train = scaler.fit_transform(x_train): Applying standardization to the training data.
x_test = scaler.transform(x_test): Applying standardization to the test data using the scaler fitted on the training data.
Defining the neural network model using TensorFlow Keras:

The model consists of 6 hidden layers and 1 output layer, with "relu" activation functions for the hidden layers and "softmax" for the output layer.
Compiling the model:

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy']): Compiling the model with the Adam optimizer, sparse categorical cross-entropy loss, and accuracy metric.
Import Necessary Libraries and Modules:

The code imports the required libraries, such as matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn, to create visualizations.
The code also imports the necessary modules from TensorFlow and Keras to build and train the deep learning model.
Define Batch Size and Maximum Epochs:

batch_size = 100: This sets the batch size for training the model. The batch size determines the number of samples processed before the model's internal parameters are updated.
max_epochs = 20: This sets the maximum number of training epochs or iterations the model will undergo during training.
Set Early Stopping Mechanism:

early_stopping = tf.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(patience=2): This creates an instance of EarlyStopping callback from TensorFlow Keras.
The EarlyStopping callback is used to prevent overfitting. It monitors the validation loss, and if it does not improve for a certain number of epochs (patience), training is stopped early.
Training the Model:

result = model.fit(...): This fits the model to the training data using the fit method from Keras.
The x_train and y_train are used as input features and target labels, respectively, for training the model.
The batch_size and max_epochs parameters control the training process.
verbose=1 prints training progress during each epoch, showing the loss and metrics values.
Visualizing the Training History:

After training, the code stores the history of accuracy, validation accuracy, loss, and validation loss in the result variable.
These metrics are used for visualizing the model's performance during training.
Creating Visualization - Training History:

The code uses matplotlib and seaborn to create a subplot with two axes to visualize the training history (accuracy and loss) during each epoch.
The training and validation accuracy are plotted against the number of epochs on the first axis (ax1).
The training and validation loss are plotted against the number of epochs on the second axis (ax2).
The title and legends are added to the plot to provide context and readability.
Evaluate Model Performance on Test Data:

After training and visualization, the model's performance is evaluated on the test set using model.evaluate method.
The x_test and y_test are used as input features and target labels, respectively, for evaluating the model's performance.
The evaluation results (test loss and test accuracy) are printed to the console.
Fine-tuning the Model:

The code further fine-tunes the model by recompiling it with a new optimizer configuration (SGD with a different learning rate and momentum).
The model is then re-trained with more epochs (30 in this case) while specifying initial_epoch=10 to continue training from epoch 11.
An additional EarlyStopping callback is used to prevent overfitting during the fine-tuning process.
Evaluate Fine-tuned Model:

The model's performance is evaluated on the test set again after fine-tuning.
The evaluation results (test loss and test accuracy) are printed to the console.

Importing Libraries: We start by bringing in some tools to help us draw graphs and visualize data. Think of it like getting our crayons and paper ready for drawing.

Counting Classes: Next, we want to see how many "benign" and "malware" samples we have in our data. It's like counting how many red and blue balloons we have in a bag.

Creating a Bar Chart: After counting the classes, we draw a bar chart to show the counts. It's like making a drawing with bars, where the height of each bar represents how many samples of each class we have.

Correlation Heatmap: Now, we want to see if any of our features (or attributes) are related to each other. It's like finding out if playing with toys makes us feel happy, sad, or not feeling much difference at all. We'll use colors to show how related these features are to each other.

Showing the Plot: Finally, we put everything we drew on the paper and show it to our friends. They can see the bar chart and the colorful map of relationships between features.

Splitting Data: Now, we need to divide our data into two parts: one part to learn from (like studying for a test), and the other part to see how well we learned (like taking the test). It's like sharing our toys with friends so they can play with some while we play with the rest.

Data Normalization: Before starting our learning and testing, we need to make sure everything is in the same scale. It's like putting all our toys in the same size box so we can compare them better.
Preparing the Data: Before we start, we need to make sure all our data is in the same range. It's like putting all our toys in the same box so they can play together nicely.

Creating the Model: Now, imagine we are building a special toy detector. We want it to look at different toys and tell us if they are toys we like (like teddy bears) or toys we don't like (like scary monsters).

The Toy Detector's Brain: The brain of our toy detector will have several parts, just like our brain helps us see, hear, and feel different things. Our toy detector's brain will have layers, and each layer will help it understand different aspects of the toys.

The First Layer: The first layer of our toy detector's brain is like a magic filter. It looks at the toys and tries to find special patterns that tell us if they are good toys or not. It will look for things like the color, shape, and size of the toys.

More Layers: We have six more layers in our toy detector's brain, and each one looks at the patterns found by the previous layer to understand even more about the toys.

The Final Decision: The last layer of our toy detector's brain will make the final decision. It will say, "Yes, this is a toy we like!" or "No, this is not a toy we like!" based on all the information it gathered from the other layers.

Putting It All Together: We connect all the layers together to make the complete brain for our toy detector.

Training the Brain: Now, we need to teach our toy detector's brain how to recognize good toys from bad toys. We'll show it many toys and tell it if they are good or bad. It will learn from these examples, just like we learn from our parents and teachers.

The Test: Once our toy detector's brain has learned enough, we'll test it to see how well it can tell if a toy is good or bad. It's like giving it some new toys and seeing if it can give us the right answers.
Getting Ready to Train: Before we start training our toy detector (remember the one we built earlier?), we need to prepare some things.

Batch Size: Think of our toy detector as a student in a big classroom. The batch size tells us how many toys the detector will look at together before it takes a break and learns from its mistakes. Here, we set the batch size to 100, so it will look at 100 toys at a time.

Training Epochs: Training is like learning and practicing. We tell our toy detector to practice recognizing toys many times, and each time it practices, we call it an epoch. Here, we set the maximum number of epochs to 20, so our toy detector will practice recognizing toys 20 times.

Early Stopping: Sometimes, our toy detector gets really good at recognizing toys quickly. But sometimes, it takes a bit longer to get better. Early stopping helps us be patient with our toy detector. We set a little timer, and if the detector doesn't get much better after a few tries, we stop training early. This helps us avoid spending too much time practicing when we already know how to recognize toys well enough.

Training Begins: Now, it's time to teach our toy detector how to recognize toys! We show it many toys and tell it if they are good or bad. It learns from these examples, just like we learn from our parents and teachers.

Training Progress: As our toy detector practices, we keep track of how well it's doing. We measure its accuracy, which is like counting how many toys it got right out of the ones it looked at. We also measure its loss, which is like how much it still needs to learn to get even better at recognizing toys.

Drawing the Progress: We draw a picture to see how well our toy detector is doing. One picture shows how its accuracy is improving as it practices more. The other picture shows how much better it gets at recognizing toys as it practices.

The Test: After our toy detector finishes practicing, we give it a test to see how well it remembers what it learned. We show it some new toys and ask it to tell us if they are good or bad. The test will tell us how good our toy detector has become!

The Results: Finally, we find out how well our toy detector did on the test. We measure its accuracy and loss again to see if it can still recognize toys as well as when it was practicing.
More Practice for Our Toy Detector: Our toy detector is really smart, but we want it to be even better! So, we are giving it more practice with some special rules.

New Practice Schedule: Our toy detector will now practice 30 times, just like before. But this time, we will start from the 11th practice session because it already did some practice earlier.

The Special Rules: To make sure our toy detector keeps learning and doesn't memorize everything, we have some special rules. First, we use a tiny learning rate (0.001) to take small steps when learning. It's like taking baby steps instead of big jumps. Second, we slowly decrease the learning rate as it practices more, so it learns to be more careful as it gets better. Third, we use something called momentum (0.9) to help it keep going in the right direction. Lastly, we use a technique called "nesterov" to make sure it doesn't get lost while practicing.

Training Again: Now, we let our toy detector practice again with the new rules and see how well it does. We'll keep track of its progress and see if it gets even better than before.

The Final Test: After all the practice, we want to see how good our toy detector has become. We give it a test with new toys and see if it can still recognize them correctly.

The Results: After the test, we find out how well our toy detector did. We measure its accuracy and loss again, just like before, to see how well it recognized the new toys.

The Verdict: Finally, we have the results! We know how well our toy detector can recognize toys now. We'll check its accuracy and see if it's a really good toy detector.
